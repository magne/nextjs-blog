Layers. Onions have layers. Ogres have layers. Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers.

Oh, you both have layers. Oh. You know, not everybody like onions.

```js
const year = "2001";
const movie = "Shrek";

console.log(`${movie}, ${year}`);
```

Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following
equation.

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$
